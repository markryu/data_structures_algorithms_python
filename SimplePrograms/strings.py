Strings are sequence of characters.

Operators ---- == > < ----

Indexing works on strings.
    - This means that you can get an element from the string depending on index.

Slicing also works on strings.
    - A part of the string can be taken away into a new copy.
string[start:stop:step]
    - This is a sample of a slice
        string[::-1] ---> reverse

Strings are immutable
    - that means strings are write-protected

Strings can also be looped over
    - it is similar to an array of characters.

You have to redefine immutable objects in order to change them.
    - That means that you have to create a new version of the item.
